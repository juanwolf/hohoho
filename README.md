# Ho Ho Ho

Collection of my solutions of [adventofcode](https://adventofcode.com)

## 2019

All the exercises will be done in Rust (I hope).

I am using the awesome [cargo-aoc](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) project to run those exercises.

To run those exercises:

```
cargo aoc -y 2019
```

You can copy those exercises but what's the point, seriously?
